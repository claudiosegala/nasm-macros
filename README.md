# NASM Macros

This are some macros made in NASM to understand better how things (conditionals) work behind the scenes. There is also an fibonacci code.

## Macros Built

+ If
+ Switch
+ While
+ Do While
+ For

## Small code built

+ Fibonacci

## Why
When you understand how things work behind the scenes and you can work with that, you gain more liberty around what you could do.
This code can be used in a C or C++ code to improve performance on some activities. The codes in the repository are not exactly better then the original, but are some examples what could be made.
It also permits to extend the functionalities of the language, like creating an _unless_ conditional or an operation that you can simplify better than the compiler. 

## Improving the repository

If you want to improve this repository, make sure you know a little about NASM. [This tutorial](http://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/nasmtutorial/) might help you.
